# More Efficient Isogeny Proofs of Knowledge via Canonical Modular Polynomials ([ePrint: 2024/1738](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1738))

- The script `additional_computations.sage` verifies the computational claims in the proofs on Proposition 5, Lemma 6, Lemma 7, Theorem 9 (excluding the claim relayed to Proposition 22) and Remark 5.
-  The script `constraints.sage` expresses and verifies all arithmetizations; furthermore it automatically counts the number of constraints, variabls and non-zero entries.
-  The script `kernel_polynomials.sage` verifies the computational claims in the proof of the Reconstruction Theorem.
-  The script `maximal_primes.sage` verifies the computational claims needed to determine the maximal prime for which there exist at least three undirected edges between some pair of vertices in the supersingular isogeny graph (Proposition 22).
- The script `splitting_special.sage` verifies the claim of Proposition 11 in small prime characteristics, as excluded in the proof.
